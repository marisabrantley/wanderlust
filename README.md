# Wanderlust Project

Feel the need to get away? For the last project of Codecademy's JavaScript course, we created a travel website to display the weather and points of interest of a city entered by the user.

This was accomplished using fetch, async, and await functions to request information from Foursquare and OpenWeather APIs.
